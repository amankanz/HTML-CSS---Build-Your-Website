Cascading Style Sheet at the most basic level it indicates that the order of the css rules matter.


- .class
- #id
- \* =>  All elements
- element
- element, element
- element element
- element > element
- element + element
- :hover
- :last-child
- :first-child
- !important (not recommended)

What selectors win out in the cascade depends on:
- Specificity (The more specific something the more lucly it will win out)
- Importance
- Source Order
